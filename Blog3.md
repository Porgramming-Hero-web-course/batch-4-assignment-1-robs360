why should we use type guard and necsessity of it?

Ans:
In TypeScript, a type guard is a technique 
used to narrow the type of a variable within a
 conditional block, ensuring that the variable has a 
 more specific type based on certain conditions. 
 It allows us to write more precise type-checking 
 logic, helping TypeScript understand what
  type a variable has within a specific scope.


Benefits of Type Guards:
1.Improved Type Safety: They help ensure that variables are of the expected type when performing operations.
2.Better Type Inference: TypeScript can infer the exact type within specific blocks, reducing errors and improving code reliability.
